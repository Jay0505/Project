This project is based upon the algorithm proposed by Martin Sulzmann and Lu in the paper 
“POSIX REGULAR EXPRESSION PARSING WITH DERIVATIVES”. This algorithm uses an old concept in 
the computer science “Derivative of a regular expression” proposed by Brozozowski. This 
algorithm is comprised of three main functions namely
                     
♣	Derivative()
♣	Nullable()
♣	Mkeps()
♣	Inject()


The main advantage of this algorithm is that apart from specifying whether a given string 
is matched by given regular expression or not, this algorithm also specifies how the regular 
expression matches the string. For full detailed information about this algorithm, please go 
through the report attached on the GitHub account.
