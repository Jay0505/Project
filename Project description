Brozozowskiâ€™s derivatives of a regular expression is an old, yet rich, system for transforming regular patterns to deterministic finite automata. It effortlessly incorporates extending the regular expression operators with boolean operations, for example, intersection and complement. Tragically, this method has been lost in the sands of time and few computer researchers know about it.
